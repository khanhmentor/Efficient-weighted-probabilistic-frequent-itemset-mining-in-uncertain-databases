     Instructions for Running Java Source Code
     To successfully compile and run the Java source code provided in this report, follow these steps:

     a. Environment Setup:
     Ensure that Java is installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the official Oracle website.

     b. Dependencies:
     The Java implementation requires jfreechart-1.0.19.jar and jcommon-1.0.23.jar for charting purposes. Make sure these JAR files are located in 'lib' folder, which is in the same directory as the source code.

     c. Compiling the Code:
     Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the Java source files are located.
     Compile the code using the following command:
     javac -cp ".;lib/jfreechart-1.0.19.jar;lib/jcommon-1.0.23.jar" Main.java

     d. Running the Application:
     After compilation, run the application using:
     java -cp ".;lib/jfreechart-1.0.19.jar;lib/jcommon-1.0.23.jar" Main

     e. Troubleshooting:
     + If you encounter classpath errors, ensure that the path to the JAR file is correctly specified in the compile and run commands.
     + For any other issues, refer to the Java documentation or reach out for support at "518H0520@student.tdtu.edu.vn".
